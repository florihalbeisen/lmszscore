## lmszscore -  Calculation of z scores from LMS refernce values

This package allows to calculate BMI and height z scores 
using LMS reference parameters in R. 

Z scores are caculated using following formula: 

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Z_{ind}&space;=&space;\frac{\left&space;[&space;y/M(t)&space;\right&space;]^{L(t)}&space;-&space;1}{S(t)L(t)}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Z_{ind}&space;=&space;\frac{\left&space;[&space;y/M(t)&space;\right&space;]^{L(t)}&space;-&space;1}{S(t)L(t)}" title="Z_{ind} = \frac{\left [ y/M(t) \right ]^{L(t)} - 1}{S(t)L(t)}" /></a>
